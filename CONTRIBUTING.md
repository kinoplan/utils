# Contributing

## Code of Conduct

Current project supports the [Scala code of conduct][code-of-conduct] and
wants all of its channels (GitHub, etc.) to be inclusive environments.

## Requirements

You will need the following tools:

* [Git][git]
* [Java 8][java-8]
* [SBT][sbt]
* [Docker][docker]

## Workflow

1. Create your own [fork][fork-and-pull] of the repository
   and work in a local branch based on `main`
2. Write code
3. [Write tests](#write-tests)
4. Run `sbt format` (or `sbt fix` and `sbt fmt` sequentially) before creating the pull request
5. [Submit a pull request](#submit-a-pull-request)

## Formatting

### Scalafix

We use [scalafix][scalafix] to apply some rules that are configured in `.scalafix.conf`.
Make sure to run `sbt fix` to apply those rules.

### Scalafmt

We use [scalafmt][scalafmt] to format the source code according to the rules
described in `.scalafmt.conf`, and recommend you to setup your editor to “format on save”,
as documented [here][scalafmt-install].
Make sure to run `sbt fmt` to ensure code formatting.

### RemarkLint

We use [remark-lint][remark-lint] to format the markdown according to the rules described in `.remarkrc`.
If you have made any changes to one of the markdown files, run the formatting as follows:

1. Install [remark-cli][remark-cli]: `npm install -g remark-cli`
2. Install [remark-preset-lint-recommended][remark-preset-lint-recommended]: `npm install remark-preset-lint-recommended`
3. Run formatting: `remark . -o`

## Write tests

Project uses testing library [ScalaTest][scalatest], and organizes tests according to the following guidelines:

* An assertion in regular tests should be written with `assert` and `===`.

## Submit a pull request

* Pull requests should be submitted from a separate branch (e.g. using
  `git checkout -b "username/fix-123"`).
* In general we discourage force pushing to an active pull-request branch that other people are
  commenting on or contributing to, and suggest using `git merge master` during development. Once
  development is complete, use `git rebase master` and force push to [clean up the history][squash].
* The first line of a commit message should be no more than 72 characters long (to accommodate
  formatting in various environments).
* Commit messages should general use the present tense, normal sentence capitalization, and no final
  punctuation.
* If a pull request decreases code coverage more than by 5%, please file an issue to make sure that
  tests get added.

## Publish a Release (note for maintainers)

Push a Git tag into `main` branch:

```bash
$ git tag v0.0.1
$ git push origin v0.0.1
```

If release build fails, delete the tag from `main` branch

```bash
$ git tag -d v0.0.1
$ git push origin :refs/tags/v0.0.1
```

then make the corrections and try again.
